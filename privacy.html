                <h3>4.3 Your Data Protection Philosophy: Encryption First</h3>
                <p>At Plaintext, we take your privacy extremely seriously. Here's how we protect your data in our cloud infrastructure:</p>
                <p><strong>What We Store:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your authentication identity (via secure provider reference)</li>
                    <li>Your user account and organization information</li>
                    <li>Your preferences and configuration settings</li>
                    <li>Business data you choose to store in our services</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>How We Protect It:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>All personally identifiable information (PII)</strong> stored on Plaintext's servers is <strong>encrypted end-to-end</strong></li>
                    <li>Only reference identifiers are stored in plain text (for data linking purposes)</li>
                    <li>Encryption keys are managed securely and rotated regularly</li>
                    <li>Keys are never transmitted with encrypted data</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>We Are Not a Data Broker:</strong><br>Plaintext is not a data broker. We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with data brokers or similar third parties for any purpose. Your data is never used for data brokerage, profiling, or resale to external parties.</p>
                <p><strong>We Don't Sell Your Data:</strong> Plaintext does not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing or commercial purposes. Encryption ensures that even if unauthorized access were to occur, your sensitive data remains protected and valueless to bad actors.</p>
                <p><strong>Maximum Security Against Breaches:</strong> In the unlikely event that Plaintext's systems were ever compromised, attackers would only gain access to encrypted data. Without the encryption keys, your personal information would be completely useless to them. This "defense in depth" approach ensures your data is protected even in worst-case scenarios.</p>
                <div style="background:#f9f9f9; border-left:4px solid #0078d4; padding:1rem; margin:1.5rem 0;">
                    <p><strong>Example - What a Data Breach Would Look Like:</strong></p>
                    <pre style="background:#f4f4f4; padding:1rem; border-radius:6px; overflow-x:auto; font-size:0.9rem;">User ID: auth0|507f1f77bcf86cd799439011
First Name: h7K9m2Lp8qX5vN3jBzF1aY0wDe4tR6sU
Last Name: m5Nx8pK2lQ6vT9jE3sW0pF4aL7rD1cM
Organization: k2L7mN9pQ4rS6tU8vW0xY3zA5bC8dE</pre>
                    <p style="margin:0;">Without the encryption keys (which are stored separately and securely), this data is completely unreadable and unusable to attackers. Your actual personal information remains completely safe.</p>
                </div>
                <p><strong>Industry Best Practice:</strong><br>This encryption-by-default approach exceeds many industry standards and demonstrates our commitment to protecting your privacy regardless of circumstances. You can use Plaintext with confidence knowing that your data is protected by the strongest encryption standards available.</p>
                <h3>4.4 Data Retention</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Authentication tokens are retained for the duration of your session</li>
                    <li>User account data is retained while your account is active</li>

                </ul>
